# skin-cancer-detection-2024
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks implementing deep learning models for Skin Cancer Detection and Segmentation. The project progresses from simple binary/multi-class classification to advanced segmentation using U-Net variants and hybrid models. It uses datasets like HAM10000 (for 2/7 labels) and DermNet/Skin Disease (for 9 classes).
